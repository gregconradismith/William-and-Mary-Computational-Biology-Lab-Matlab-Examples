# Computational Biology Lab @ William & Mary

This repository contains materials for research students in the [Computational Biology Laboratory](https://wmcbl.wordpress.com) at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu). Anyone interested in the mathematical aspects of life sciences is welcome to use and contribute to these materials.

## Decription 

Most of the contents of this repository are topically organized **examples**, **helps**, or **notes**. For example, the directory/folder titled `LaTeX` includes example `.tex` files and other resources to help you learn how to typeset publication-quality mathematical equations. The folders `Nonlinear Dynamics` and `Linear Algebra` contain links to recommended videos, Matlab scripts, and Sagemath Jupyter Notebooks to help you explore these mathematical topics.
