# W&M CBL Examples

This repository contains materials for research students in the [Computational Biology Laboratory](https://wmcbl.wordpress.com) at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu). Anyone interested in the mathematical aspects of life sciences is welcome to use and contribute to these materials.

## Decription 

Most of the contents of this repository are `examples' or `helps' that are organized topically, e.g., the directory/folder titled LaTeX includes example .tex files and other resources to help you learn how to typeset publication-quality mathematical equations. The folders *Nonlinear Dynamics* and *Linear Algebra* contain links to recommended texts and videos as well as Matlab scripts and Sagemath Jupyter Notebooks
