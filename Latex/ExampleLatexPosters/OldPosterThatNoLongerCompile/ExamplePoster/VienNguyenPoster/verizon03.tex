% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

\CHead{Introduction}

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a membrane-bound compartment within cells,
is an intracellular \Ca\ store.  
Within the cytosol, a normal [\Ca]\ reaches 0.1 \UM,\ while inside the ER the [\Ca]\ is in the range
of 10--1000 \UM.  
Transient increases of [\Ca]\ in the cytosol (approx.\ 1 \UM) is an important intracellular signal. 
Intracellular \Ca\ channels such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (\Ipr) that open and close 
in a \Ca\-regulated fashion are often responsible for these intracellular [\Ca] increases. When these ion channels are 
open or `activated', \Ca\ from inside the ER diffuses through the ER membrane into the cytosol and increases the 
cytosolic [\Ca]. Here I derive the equilibrium open probability for two minimal intracellular \Ca\ channel models.  
In the first model, \Ca\ binds the \Ipr\ and leads to activation; in the second model, a slower process of 
\Ca\ inactivation is also included.  When multiple channels of either type are modeled in a manner that accounts for 
the diffusion of \Ca\ between channels, the equilibrium open probability of this \Ca\ channel cluster or `\Ca\ release site' 
as a collective entity is found to depend on the distance between the channels, the background [\Ca], the `domain' [\Ca] 
when a channel is open, and the details of the single-channel model.

The two-state \Ipr\ \Ca\ channel model accounts for \Ca\ activation and includes two rate constants ($k^-$ and $k^+$).
The latter rate constant is bimolecular and the rate of activation is given by $k^+c_\infty$ where $c_\infty$ is 
the background or `bulk' [\Ca]. 
\end{minipage}
\\

Equilibrium open probability for the two-state \Ipr\ model:
\[0 = \frac {dP_o} {dt} = k^+c_\infty P_c - k^-P_o\]
\[0 = \frac {dP_c} {dt} = k^-P_c - k^+c_\infty P_o\]
\[P_c = 1 - P_o \]
\[P_o = \frac {k^+ c_\infty} {k^+(c_\infty + k^-)} = 
\frac {c_\infty} {c_\infty+K} \] 
where $K = k^-/k^+$.

\CHead{Calculating P$_o^{eq}$ for the Four-State Model}

Using ODEs similar to the two-state model, the equilibrium open probability is found to be:
\[ P_{o}^{eq} = z_O/D \]
where $D = z_{C1} + z_O + z_{C2} + z_{C3}$ and
\bnea z_{C_1} &=& \kappa_b^+ \kappa_c^- \kappa_d^- + \kappa_a^- \kappa_d^-
\kappa_c^- + \kappa_b^- \kappa_a^- \kappa_d^- + \kappa_c^+ \kappa_b^-
\kappa_a^- \\  z_{O} &=& \kappa_d^+ \kappa_c^+ \kappa_b^- + \kappa_c^-
\kappa_d^- \kappa_a^+ + \kappa_d^- \kappa_a^+ \kappa_b^- + \kappa_a^+
\kappa_b^- \kappa_c^+ \\  z_{C_2} &=& \kappa_b^+ \kappa_d^+ \kappa_c^+ +

\kappa_a^+ \kappa_b^+ \kappa_c^+ \\ z_{C_3} &=& \kappa_d^+ \kappa_b^+

As background \Ca\ 
concentration increases, the equilibrium open probability of the four-state model first increases and then decreases.
This bell-shaped curve is typical of the type 1 \Ipr. 
Parameters follow De~Young and Keizer 1992: 
$k_a^+$ = 20 $\uM^{-1}sec^{-1}$, $k_a^-$ = 1.6468 $sec^{-1}$, $k_b^+$ = 0.2 $\uM^{-1} sec^{-1}$, $k_b^-$ = 0.2 $sec^{-1}$, $k_c^+$ = 20 $\uM^{-1}sec^{-1}$, $k_c^-$ = 1.6468 $sec^{-1}$, $k_d^+$ = 0.2 $\uM^{-1}sec^{-1}$.  The eighth rate constant, $k_d^-$, 
is given by a thermodynamic constraint.

\CHead{Modeling Instantaneously-Coupled Channels}
\begin{itemize}
\item In general, for any channel model, the equilibrium open 
probability can be found by solving: 
\[ 
\pi Q = 0,
\]
\vspace{0.1in} 
where $\pi$\ (a vector with length given by the number of channel states) 
is a `stationary distribution' and $Q$ is the `infinitesimal generator matrix' or  `transition matrix'
for the channel model. 

\item For example, for the two-state \Ca\ channel model, 
\[
Q = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
-k^+ c_\infty & k^+ c_\infty \\
k^- & -k^- \\
\end{array}
\right) 
\]

\item For multiple interacting \Ca\ channels, the equilibrium open probability can also be calculated
by `expanding' the transition matrix, $Q$. 
We assume fast diffusion between channels (i.e., instantaneous coupling), given by 
\[ c_{ij} = \frac {\sigma} {2\pi D r_{ij}} e^{-r_{ij}/\lambda} \]
where 
$c_{ij}$ is the concentration increase above background experienced by channel
$j$ when channel $i$ is open and 
$r_{ij}$ is the distance between the two channels. 
\\

$\sigma$ = source amplitude of \Ca\ channel \\
$r$ = distance between channels \\
$D$ = diffusion constant for \Ca \\ 
$\lambda$ = length constant for \Ca\ domain \\
\\
Note that $c_{ij}$ becomes smaller as $r_{ij}$ becomes larger, 
that is, the interaction between channels is weaker when 
the channels are farther apart.


%where the $\diamond$\ denotes the opposite of the sum of the other entries in each row
%so that $Qe = 0$ where $e$ is a commensurate unit vector.

\]

\\
\item The expanded Q matrix for three coupled four-state channels can be derived in a similar manner.  here the cluster of channels has a total of $4^3 = 256$ states (so Q$^{(3)}$ has 256x256 elements)!

The equilibrium open probability of three coupled channels arranged 
in an equilateral triangle as a function of the distance between 
the channels.  The left and right graph are for the two-state and four-state channel models, respectively.  Parameters as in the single channel simulation
above.  As expected, the two-state channels activate each other on average 
as they get close.  The four-state channels 
can either activate or inactivate each other 
on average, depending on their distance. 
However, this inactivation does not appear until the channels' distance 
is smaller than the distance between the pore and binding site of a 
single channel (r$_{ii}$).

In future work we will explore if it is true in general that closely positioned 
\Ca\ channels are unlikely to inactivate one another, even when the individual 
channel models include \Ca-inactivation.
