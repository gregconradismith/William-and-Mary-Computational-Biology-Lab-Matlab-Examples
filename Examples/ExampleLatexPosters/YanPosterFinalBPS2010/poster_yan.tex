Realistic \Ca\ release unit (CaRU) models consist of one or more L-type \Ca\ channels and multiple ryanodine receptors (RyRs). To accelerate multiscale modeling of local control of CICR in cardiac myocytes, {\bf we have implemented and validated several reduction methods applicable to mechanistic CaRU modeling} that feature an automated process of state aggregation and error evaluation.

\large The transition rates between the de-inactivated states  ($C_1$, $O_2$, and $O_3$; connected by solid line) are much faster than the transition rates to and from the inactivated state $C_2$~[2]. The 4-state RyR can be reduced to two states by lumping de-inactivated states;
\normalsize
\vspace{-0.25in}
$$ \mbox{(de-inactivated)} ~ C_1 \cup O_2 \cup O_3 \revrxn{\hat{q}_{12}}{\hat{q}_{21}} C_4 ~ \mbox{(inactivated)} . $$
\large Similarly, release sites composed of many coupled channels can be partitioned by lumping fast communicating states. (Illustrated above using two Keizer-Levine RyRs) 

\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{7.5}(7.75, 0.9)
\Head{--- Model Contraction via Fast/Slow Approximation---}
\large Fast/slow reduction requires computation of the entries of the smaller Q-matrix corresponding to the reduced model.  For example, the 10$\times$10 Q-matrix for two coupled
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{8in}
\includegraphics*[height=5in]{pics/partition}
\end{wrapfigure}
 Keizer-Levine RyRs is partitioned into a 3$\times$3 block-matrix $\boldsymbol{Q} = (\boldsymbol{Q}_{ij})$ consistent with fast/slow state space partitioning. Assuming quasi-static equilibrium between rapidly communicating states, the conditional probability distributions within each group $\hat{\bpi}_i$ are approximated by: 
$$\hat{\bpi}_i\bQ^+_{ii} = \bzero  \ \mbox{\large subject to} \ \hat{\bpi}_i \be_i = 1 $$

\noindent
\large where $ \bQ_{ii}^+= \bQ_{ii} + \mbox{diag} \left( \sum_{j\neq i} \bQ_{ij} \be_j \right).$
\large The transition rates between lumped states are:
\begin{equation}\nonumber \hat{\bQ} = (\hat{q}_{ij}) \quad \mbox{where}\quad
\left\{ \begin{array}{ccccc}
\hat{q}_{ij} & = & \hat{\bpi}_i \boldsymbol{Q}_{ij} \be_j &\qquad\qquad & i\neq j \\
\hat{q}_{ij} & = & -\sum_{j\neq i} \hat{q}_{ij} &\qquad\qquad & i = j. \\
\end{array}\right.

\Head{--- Error Measure and Model Evaluation ---}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\large To validate the automated fast/slow reduction procedure, we compare the transition probability matrix of the reduced model ($\hat{\boldsymbol{P}} = e^{t\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}}$) \large to the transition probability matrix of the full model  ($\boldsymbol{P} = e^{t\boldsymbol{Q}}$).  \large Because $\bP$ and $\hat{\bP}$ are significantly different in size ($b$ and $\hat{b}$ states, respectively), $\bP$ is contracted using a $b \times \hat{b}$ collector matrix $\boldsymbol{V}$ and a $\hat{b} \times b$ distributor matrix $\boldsymbol{U}$ where\\
\vspace{-0.1in}
\bne\nonumber
\boldsymbol{V} = \left[
\begin{array}{cccc} \be_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & \be_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & \be_{\hat{b}} \\
\end{array} \right]  \qquad  \mbox{and} \qquad 
\boldsymbol{U} = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} \bar{\bpi}_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 &
\bar{\bpi}_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots &
\bar{\bpi}_{\hat{b}} \\ \end{array} \right] .
\ene
\large Note that $\bpi = \left[ \bpi_1, \bpi_2, \cdots,  \bpi_{\hat{b}} \right] $ is the conformally partitioned exact stationary distribution of the full model satisfying $\bpi \bQ = \bzero$ subject to $\bpi \be = 1$ and
\bne\nonumber 
\bar{\bpi}_i = \frac{\bpi_i}{\bpi_i \be_i}  .
\ene


\vspace{-0.2in}  
\large To quantify the validity of the reduction we define the error matrix:
\normalsize\bne\nonumber
\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}(t) = \left| \hat{\boldsymbol{P}} (t)- \boldsymbol{U} \boldsymbol{P} (t) \boldsymbol{V}\right|
\label{Error}
\ene

\large and plot the largest element, $E_{max} (t) = \max_{ij} \hatbE_{ij} (t)$,
as a function of time.

%\begin{textblock}{3}(12.3, 9.8)

Solid curve (left) shows the error of the fast/slow reduction for a release site composed of 8 Keizer-Levine RyRs (330 $\rightarrow$ 9 states). The automated fast/slow reduction procedure is validated by the fact that $E_{max}(t)$ decreases as the rates of \Ca\ inactivation and de-inactivation are decreased by a factor of 10 and 100 (dotted and dashed lines).

\Head{--- Reduction Using Exact Conditional Distribution ---}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{7.8in}
\includegraphics[height=5.8in]{pics/NCDGoldStandard2}
\label{fig:models}
\end{wrapfigure}
\large When the time scales in the \Ca\ release site model are not well separated, the fast/slow reduction error increases because the estimates of the conditional probability distribution within 
blocks ($\hat{\bpi}_i$) become less accurate. 
However, when the rate constants $\hat{q}_{ij}$ of the reduced model are calculated using the
exact conditional probability distribution  $\bar{\bpi}_i$,
\bne \nonumber\hat{q}_{ij} = \bar{\bpi}_i \bQ_{ij} \be_j \ \mbox{for} \ i\neq j,
\ene
both the transient and  limiting ($t\rightarrow \infty$) reduction errors improve (dashed line).
Note that the storage required to calculate the exact conditional distributions is 
far in excess of that needed to estimate them via fast/slow approximation. To overcome this problem, we employ iterative aggregation/disaggregation (IAD) methods [1] to calculate the stationary distribution of full \Ca\ release site models. {\bf Numerical experiments benchmarking automated reductions of release sites composed of up to 80 RyRs consistently yielded small residuals.}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{8.0in}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\includegraphics*[height=6in]{pics/GAresult}
\end{wrapfigure}
\large When time scale separation is absent from the full model, a {\bf genetic algorithm is applied to search all possible partitions for those that result in low-error reduced models whose size is arbitrarily decided by the user.}  If a $\hat{\beta}$-state reduced model is required, 
the program will search partitions that divide the full model into $\hat{\beta}$ groups for those that yield low-error reductions (red).  A small `population' of partitions is randomly selected and the `fitness' of each partition is evaluated (blue).  The next generation of partitions is constructed as mutants of current generation partitions randomly sampled in a manner that favors high fitness (i.e., small reduction error).  

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{7.0in}
\includegraphics*[height=7.0in, angle=270]{pics/GAerror}
\end{wrapfigure}
The genetic algorithm-based reduction method can be extended to compositionally defined \Ca\ release sites with more realistic coupling. For example, when depletion of SR \Ca\ is represented and the diadic subspace [\Ca] is given by
\vspace{-0.05in}
\[
\ca(t) = c_\infty + f\( N_O, c_{SR} \),
\vspace{-0.05in}
\]
the method yields reduced models with their errors $<$1$\%$ for a wide range of SR [\Ca] ($C_{SR}$, right).
