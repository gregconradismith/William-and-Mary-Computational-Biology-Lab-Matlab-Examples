% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

\CHead{--- Introduction ---}
The effect of feedback inhibition on retinogeniculate transmission is studied
using a minimal network model that includes $\sim$10--100 representative
thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)
reciprocally connected with thalamic reticular (RE) neurons of the
perigeniculate nucleus (PGN).  \end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{5.3}(0,2.2)
\CHead{--- TC- \& RE-like IFB Models --- }
Network simulations are based on 
the {\it integrate-and-fire-or-burst} 
(IFB) model (Smith et al.~2000, Rinzel 1980)  
constructed by adding a slow variable to a classical
integrate-and-fire neuron model.  The slow variable, $h$, represents the
inactivation of the low-threshold \Ca\ conductance, $I_T$.  
\bnea
C \ddt{V} &=& - I_L - I_T \nonumber \\
  \ddt{h} &=& \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
                      -h/\tau_h^-  & \( V > V_h \) \\
                      (1-h)/\tau_h^+ & \( V < V_h \)
                      \end{array}
              \right. 
\nonumber 
\enea
A spike occurs whenever the membrane potential reaches a threshold
($V_\theta$) for firing an action potential, \[ V(t) = V_\theta
\Longrightarrow V(t^+) = V_{reset} \] and the current balance equation
includes two constant conductance leakage currents $I_L = g_{KL} \( V -
V_{KL} \) + g_{NL} \( V - V_{NL} \)$ and the low-threshold \Ca\ current, $I_T
= g_T \mu \{ V - V_h \} h \( V - V_T \)$, where $\mu$ and $h$ characterize
the activation and inactivation of $I_T$, respectively. 

A subtle change in parameters converts an IFB model designed to
reproduce TC neuron responses into an IFB model that responds like the
inhibitory RE neurons of the PGN.  
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=20cm,height=10cm,clip=]{FigMarco01.eps} \end{center}
The distinction is the relationship between $V_h$ ({\it vertical red line}),
the threshold for $I_T$, and $V_L$ ({\it filled circle}), the resting
membrane potential. In the TC-like IFB model, $I_{T}$ is inactivated at rest
($V_L > V_h$), while the RE-like IFB model is primed to burst in response to
depolarizing input ($V_{L} < V_h$).

\begin{textblock}{5.3}(5.9,1.2)
\CHead{--- Network Equations --- }
In the dLGN/PGN network, each TC and RE neuron is described
by an IFB model.  The TC cells receive spontaneous or visually-driven
excitatory synaptic currents ($I_{RET}$) and feedback inhibition from
associated RE cells ($I_{GABA}$).  The RE cells receive excitatory input from
the TC cells ($I_{AMPA}$) and are inhibited by neighboring RE cells
($I_{GABA_{RE}}$).  
\bnea 
C \ddt {V_{TC}^i} &=& - I_{MEM_{TC}}^i - I_{RET}^i - I_{GABA}^i \nonumber \\
C \ddt {V_{RE}^i} &=& - I_{MEM_{RE}}^i - I_{AMPA}^i-I_{GABA_{RE}}^i  \nonumber 
\enea 
\[ I_{syn}^i = g_{syn} \sum_{j} w_{ji} s_{j} \( V^{i} - V_{syn} \) 
\quad \mbox{where} \quad w_{ij} = w_{ij} \( | x_i - x_j | \) . \] 
where the synaptic footprint ($w_{ij}$) 
is either exponentially decaying or all-to-all 
and alpha-function postsynaptic conductances ($s_j$) are triggered by spiking
of the presynaptic neuron (Golomb et al. 1996). 

A gamma process modulated at rate $\rho(x,t)$ gives the event times for
excitatory postsynaptic conductances representing spontaneous or
visually-stimulated retinal input calculated via convolution of a
luminance profile with the spatio-temporal receptive field of one class
(e.g., Xon) of retinal ganglion cell.  Drifting grating-like retinal drive
takes the form \[ \rho \( t\) = \rho_{DC} + \rho_{AC} \cos \( 2 \pi k x - 2
\pi f t \) \] with spatial and temporal frequency $k$ and $f$, respectively.

\begin{textblock}{3.33}(0,9.7)
Subcortical neuromodulation of TC and RE neuron state is
simulated by changing the potassium leakage conductances, $g_{KL}^{TC}$ and
$g_{KL}^{RE}$.  This conductance affects $V_L$, the
de-inactivation level of $I_T$, and burst vs.\ tonic response mode of
both cell types.  Synaptic strengths in the\\ dLGN/PGN model were chosen so
in the {\it Sleep state} rhythmic bursting occurs in the presence of the
30 Hz spontaneous drive of the dark-adapted retina.  
An increase of $g_{KL}^{RE}$ and decrease of
$g_{KL}^{TC}$ puts the network into the {\it Awake State} 
and rhythmic bursting does not persist.  \end{textblock}

Feedback-inhibition from RE cells leads to
post-inhibitory rebound bursting ({\it red}) in TC cells that can dominate
network throughput. Conversely, TC cells faithfully transmit retinal input in
the absence of feedback inhibition. 
Although the network is ``awake'' and does not
support rhythmic bursting in the 
presence of spontaneous retinal drive (see {\bf
Neuromodulation}), episodes of irregular
bursting can be triggered by visually-driven retinal input.

\CHead{--- Spatial Frequency \& Transmission --- } 
In the {\it IFB Network} model and a corresponding 
firing-rate reduction ({\it FR Network}, see Smith et al.~2001),
the spatial frequency of drifting grating-like retinal drive influences the 
activity of RE cells, feedback inhibition, and throughput.
Here the temporal frequency of 4 Hz is fixed, while the spatial
frequency is varied (1--3 Hz). 
The exponential synaptic footprint has length constant 
of 1/10 the spatial domain.
At low spatial frequency the RE cells respond to periodic excitation 
from TC cells with bursts, periodically inhibit the TC cells, and 
influence network throughput.  
At high spatial frequency the RE cells fail to respond 
to periodic excitation from TC cells and the
network throughput follows the retinal drive. 
Note that the drift rate of the grating is slower
at high spatial frequency, so this phenomenon is to be distinguished
from the high temporal frequency cut-off 
in RE cell activity shown in {\bf Temporal Frequency Analysis}.
